Task Management API (Capstone Project)

Project Overview

The Task Management API is a robust backend solution built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It provides a secure, token-authenticated system for users to manage their personal tasks, complete with deadlines, priority levels, and status tracking.

This project demonstrates proficiency in building a RESTful service, handling authentication, implementing custom logic (filtering, sorting, status updates), and enforcing object-level permissions (users can only access their own tasks).

üöÄ Key Features

Feature

Details

User Authentication

Secure registration (/api/users/register/) and token-based login (/api-token-auth/).

Task CRUD

Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for tasks.

Task Ownership

Strictly enforced: a user can only view, modify, or delete tasks they own.

Status Actions

Custom endpoints to explicitly set a task status to Completed or Pending, automatically managing the completed_at timestamp.

Filtering

Filter tasks by status (Pending/Completed), priority (Low/Medium/High), or specific due_date.

Sorting

Sort task lists by due_date or priority.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/3bdoo11/Task_Management_API.git
cd Task_Management_API



Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate # Windows



Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Apply database migrations:

python manage.py makemigrations tasks
python manage.py migrate



Create an administrative user (optional):

python manage.py createsuperuser



Run the development server:

python manage.py runserver



The API will now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
